pick up here
ChatGPT said:
Got it ‚Äî we‚Äôre picking up from where you left off.

Last thing in our thread was:

You ran fix_orphans_and_enrich.py and discovered a 4th type of games ‚Äî ones that do get enriched info (cover included) but don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúbasic info‚Äù like release date, rating, genres, and platforms. You asked me to send the full script again with the added code clearly marked with comments so it‚Äôs in the right place.

Do you want me to:

Send you the fully updated script (fix_orphans_and_enrich.py) with the fix already integrated (with comments showing where the new part is)?
or

Give you the patch instructions so you can paste the extra block into your existing file manually?

Which way would you prefer?

Here‚Äôs a tight read on the script you uploaded and where it stands:

It now fills genres & platforms correctly. You added lookup/link tables (genres, platforms, game_genres, game_platforms) and wire them in via upsert_genres_platforms(...), plus you updated needs_enrich(...) to also trigger when a game is missing those join rows. This directly addresses your ‚Äútype-4‚Äù cases that had cover/description but no genres/platforms. 

Core enrichment is robust: upsert_game_core(...) both inserts cores (id/slug/name/released/rating) and backfills enrichables (description, website, age_rating, cover_image). Covers are normalized, with a fallback from RAWG screenshot API if the cover is still empty. Screenshots are recorded (up to 40) into a simple screenshots table. 

Schema safety: ensure_schema(...) idempotently creates all the aux tables and indexes and adds columns on games for description, website, age_rating, cover_image. (It assumes your games table already has released and rating‚Äîwhich matches your existing DB.) 

Control flow matches your workflow:

If you pass IDs (python fix_orphans_and_enrich.py 27 123,456), it enriches just those, with a quick boolean summary per field.

Otherwise it: (1) looks for folder-named IDs under screenshots/, (2) upserts any missing games by calling the RAWG detail endpoint, then (3) scans all games and re-enriches any that still need data (including the new genre/platform checks). 

Rate-limit/backoff: basic retry with a 60s sleep on 429s and exponential-ish pauses on 50x. 

One gap I still see (easy fix)
Your ‚Äútype-4‚Äù description also mentioned ‚Äúbasic info like age(rating).‚Äù You‚Äôre already backfilling ESRB age rating and checking for it, but you don‚Äôt currently treat missing released or rating as reasons to re-enrich. If some rows were inserted earlier without those, they won‚Äôt be picked up by needs_enrich(...).

Quick patch (minimal, drop-in):

# In needs_enrich(...), extend the first SELECT to also surface released/rating emptiness:
cur.execute("""
    SELECT
      COALESCE(description,'') = '' AS no_about,
      COALESCE(website,'')     = '' AS no_site,
      COALESCE(age_rating,'')  = '' AS no_age,
      COALESCE(cover_image,'') = '' AS no_cover,
      released IS NULL         AS no_released,
      rating IS NULL           AS no_rating
    FROM games WHERE id = ?
""", (gid,))
row = cur.fetchone()
if not row:
    return True

no_about, no_site, no_age, no_cover, no_released, no_rating = [bool(x) for x in row]

# ...later keep your existing checks and add the two new flags:
return any([
    no_about, no_site, no_age, no_cover,
    no_released, no_rating,      # ‚Üê NEW
    no_devs, no_pubs, no_tags, no_series, no_adds,
    no_genres, no_platforms
])
Why this helps: if a game was created in DB without released/rating (older runs, partial inserts, or manual rows), the pass that ‚Äúscans all games for missing fields‚Äù will catch and fix them.

Sanity checks you can run now
Single-ID smoke test:
python fix_orphans_and_enrich.py 27
Confirm the line that prints cover=, about=, site=, age= shows True after running (then spot-check genres/platforms in DB).

Global sweep:
Run with no args. Watch the ‚ÄúScanning X games‚Ä¶‚Äù phase‚Äîit should now also revisit rows missing release date/rating and fill them in.

If you want, I can ship a full file with that tiny needs_enrich patch integrated and marked with # ADD: comments, or give you a micro-diff in context‚Äîyour call.

You said:
Side question: if I were to just run a full RAWG fetch for everything (basic info, enriched info, screenshots, cover, everything) for a SINGLE game (by it's ID or slug) how many RAWG requests would that use? (again, for a single game)
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a second

Thought for 27s
Short answer: ~4 RAWG requests per game in your current flow ‚Äî sometimes 5.

Breakdown (for a single game ID/slug) using your script:

1√ó GET /games/{id} for full details (name, released, rating, ESRB, genres, platforms, tags, devs/pubs, short_screenshots, background images). 

1√ó GET /games/{id}/game-series to populate related series links. 

1√ó GET /games/{id}/additions to populate DLC/additions links. 

1√ó GET /games/{id}/screenshots to fill your screenshots table (first page, up to 40 saved). 

Sometimes it‚Äôs 5: if the game‚Äôs cover_image isn‚Äôt present after details, your cover_fallback_from_screens() will call the screenshots API once, and then store_screenshots() will call it again because the fallback doesn‚Äôt insert into screenshots. That‚Äôs the extra hit. 

(Edge cases: Retries on 429/5xx add extra requests, and if screenshots already exist in DB, that last call is skipped.) 

If you want to guarantee exactly 4, we can cache the screenshots response from the fallback and pass it into store_screenshots() (or only fetch screenshots once and use those URLs both for cover and DB insert).

You said:
i am going to be adding and/or revising what i want from each game page. don't try and reconfigure or change the fetch script after each of my changes. save till the end, which i will tell you when i think that is. 
mostly i will be telling you what i want to add or change. i may ask you a question, please answer simply without codes yet. otherwise, do not interrupt please. train of thought. 
please stand by

Copy. I‚Äôm on standby.
I won‚Äôt change the fetch script until you say to consolidate.
If you ask a question, I‚Äôll answer simply‚Äîwith no code.

You said:
developers and developers_list: redundant?
publishers and publishers_list: redundant?
they seem so
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî they‚Äôre redundant.

developers / publishers ‚Üí These are the raw arrays from RAWG‚Äôs /games/{id} response.

game_developers / game_publishers tables (your ‚Äú*_list‚Äù) ‚Üí These are just your normalized storage of those same values (so you can query them efficiently in SQL).

So conceptually:

Developers and Publishers fields in the JSON are sources.

developers_list and publishers_list in your DB schema are where you persist them.

You don‚Äôt really need to keep both around separately unless you want the raw JSON copy and a normalized SQL form.

You said:
leave them as is then
ChatGPT said:
Understood ‚Äî we‚Äôll leave both forms (raw fields and normalized list tables) as they are. Standing by for your next addition or revision.

You said:
I don't know where the RAWG fetcher finds the rating. I'm really interested in the Metascore rating. so keep the current 'rating' as is (wherever it is pulled from) but also add the Metascore rating. in addition to the metascore being a number it also a color that depends on the number, i want both to represent the Metascore rating. in conclusion the fetcher will continue to grab the current rating, but also add a new rating field for the Metascore (number and color)
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 7s
Got it.

We‚Äôll keep the current rating (that‚Äôs RAWG‚Äôs user rating).

We‚Äôll also add Metascore from RAWG‚Äôs metacritic:

metascore_number: the numeric score (0‚Äì100).

metascore_color: based on the number:

Green: 75‚Äì100

Yellow: 50‚Äì74

Red: 0‚Äì49

If no Metascore exists, both will be empty.

I‚Äôll hold implementation until you say ‚Äúgo.‚Äù

You said:
in RAWG website: things such as genres, platforms and tags are internal links to say: https://rawg.io/games/sports, https://rawg.io/games/pc, and https://rawg.io/tags/singleplayer
eventually they will go to my own site: latestgames.com/games/sports, etc. 
is this something concerning the fetcher? or is that something to worry about later?
ChatGPT said:
That‚Äôs something to worry about later ‚Äî it‚Äôs not a fetcher concern.

The fetcher just stores the names/IDs (genres, platforms, tags). Turning those into links (to RAWG or to latestgames.com) happens in your frontend rendering layer.

So:

Fetcher ‚Üí collect and normalize data.

Frontend/website ‚Üí decide where each label links (RAWG now, LatestGames.com later).

No need to adjust the fetcher for that.

will talk about cover later. this conversation is about 'screenshots'
regarding ALL games! but for this conversation using the example https://rawg.io/games/dirt-4/screenshots
there are 21 "screenshots", however 6 of them are actually videos, 15 are simple screenshots
first, i want all screenshots.
second, i want the videos as well. i know that will take time, and disk space. will those also take up more requests? if not downloading the videos themselves right now, i want to grab the link, as well download a URL shortcut file for each video
any thoughts? suggestions?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 12s
Great focus. Here‚Äôs how RAWG handles this and what it means for you‚Äîno code yet:

Screenshots vs. videos come from different endpoints.

Images: GET /games/{id}/screenshots

Videos: GET /games/{id}/movies (these are the ‚Äúvideos‚Äù you see mixed into the RAWG gallery)

Requests impact (per game):

Images: the screenshots endpoint is paginated. If a game has more than one page of screenshots, you‚Äôll use 1 request per page to get them all. (Your current script only grabs the first page‚Äîhence up to ~20ish; Dirt 4‚Äôs 21 would require page 2 as well.)

Videos: the movies endpoint is a single extra request (no heavy pagination in practice‚Äîcounts are small).

So yes: pulling all images + videos costs more requests than your current ‚Äúfirst page of images only.‚Äù Rough mental model: images = ceil(total_screens / page_size) + 1 for videos.

Not downloading videos now?

Totally fine. You can store:

Direct video URL (RAWG serves MP4s on their CDN)

Preview/thumbnail URL (RAWG provides these too)

Title/order (for display)

URL shortcut files (e.g., .url) are easy to generate later; they don‚Äôt reduce API usage, but they do avoid disk bloat versus downloading the MP4s.

Practical suggestions:

Fetch all screenshots by paging through until done; keep your current ‚Äúcap‚Äù (e.g., 40) if you want, or lift it game-by-game.

Add one movies call per game to capture all video metadata (URL, preview, name).

Store media in one normalized table with a type field (image/video), url, preview_url (for videos), width/height if available, and a stable position for ordering.

Defer downloads (especially videos) to a separate, opt-in ‚Äúasset fetcher‚Äù step later. For now, store URLs only to keep disk usage low.

Set a soft quota (e.g., first 50 images, all videos) to keep request count predictable; you can always deepen later.

Cache wisely: if you use the screenshots response for cover fallback, reuse that same data to populate your screenshots table so you don‚Äôt hit the screenshots endpoint twice.

If you want, once you say ‚Äúgo,‚Äù I‚Äôll fold in: full screenshots pagination, a lightweight movies pull, and fields to track media type/order‚Äîwithout downloading videos yet.

You said:
yea go ahead and add in all practical suggestions.
additionally, go ahead and add in the Meatscore stuff we discussed earlier:
We‚Äôll keep the current rating (that‚Äôs RAWG‚Äôs user rating).
We‚Äôll also add Metascore from RAWG‚Äôs metacritic:
metascore_number: the numeric score (0‚Äì100).
metascore_color: based on the number:
Green: 75‚Äì100
Yellow: 50‚Äì74
Red: 0‚Äì49
If no Metascore exists, both will be empty.

It‚Äôs in the canvas as an updated fix_orphans_and_enrich.py. If you want me to drop the soft cap, rename fields, or avoid touching the legacy screenshots table, say the word. Standing by.
